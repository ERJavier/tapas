# TAPAS Development Rule

Build TAPAS as **"a modern, beautiful htop for ports"**: small, sharp, terminal-native, and delightful.

## Product Priorities

- Prioritize clarity, speed, and keyboard-driven UX over feature breadth.
- Keep interactions responsive; avoid UI flicker and blocking refresh paths.
- Favor minimal UI and clear information density over decorative complexity.
- Target macOS and Linux only (no first-party Windows scope right now).

## Architecture Guardrails

- Keep system logic and UI logic separated.
- UI code must not execute OS commands directly.
- Implement port/process behavior in `internal/ports/`; render and input handling in `internal/ui/`.
- Preserve a stable core model shaped around port metadata (port, pid, process, protocol, uptime/start time, working dir).

## Delivery Sequence (Roadmap Discipline)

- Build in phases:
  - v0.1 MVP: list listening ports, navigate, kill, refresh, quit.
  - v0.2 UX: sort, filter, detail/confirm modals, color semantics.
  - v1.0 Smart detection: framework badges, Docker detection, watch mode.
- Do not jump to phase-3 features until MVP stability is solid on macOS and Linux.

## Non-Goals Enforcement

Reject or defer changes that introduce:
- cloud integration
- telemetry
- background daemons
- auto-kill scripts
- broad Windows-specific implementation work

## Decision Filter

When proposing or implementing a change, prefer options that:
1. improve developer workflow clarity
2. keep TAPAS lightweight
3. maintain clean separations in architecture

If a feature does not improve clarity or developer workflow, it does not belong.
