# TAPAS UX Principles and Interaction Guidelines

Design TAPAS as a modern, beautiful "htop for ports": fast, focused, calm, keyboard-first, and predictable.

## UX Philosophy

- TAPAS must feel like a serious developer tool.
- Prioritize speed, clarity, and confidence over novelty.
- Keep personality subtle: slightly playful, mostly professional.
- No emojis in TAPAS app UI copy.

## Core UX Principles

### Clarity Over Density

Show only high-value information by default:
- Port
- Process
- Project (working directory)
- Uptime
- Protocol (when useful)

Avoid visual noise, decorative clutter, and unnecessary borders.

### Keyboard Is Primary

Every core interaction must be available without a mouse.

Required keys:
- `Up` / `Down` / `Right`: navigate
- `Enter`: inspect details
- `k`: kill selected process/port
- `r`: refresh
- `/`: search/filter
- `s`: sort
- `q`: quit (and close modals where appropriate)

Avoid multi-key combinations unless absolutely necessary.

### Speed Is UX

- Refresh should feel instant.
- Do not block the UI during data updates.
- Avoid flicker and full redraws unless required.
- If refresh exceeds ~300ms, show a subtle loading indicator.

### Forgiving but Safe

Destructive actions must:
- require explicit confirmation,
- clearly state what will happen,
- never be silent.

Never auto-kill. Never hide consequences.

Example confirmation copy:
`Kill port 3000 (node)? [y] Confirm [n] Cancel`

### Visual Hierarchy and Color

Color must communicate state, not decoration:
- selected row: highlighted,
- long-running ports (>24h): soft red,
- common dev ports (3000-3005): blue,
- common databases (for example 5432, 6379): purple,
- system processes: muted.

Color cannot be the only signal; always support symbols/text cues.
Choose styles that remain legible in dark terminals.

### Stability Above Features

If a feature adds instability or avoidable complexity, remove or defer it.
TAPAS should always feel rock-solid.

## Interaction Model

### Default Screen

Use a table view of listening ports with persistent selection visibility.
Include a bottom status/help bar with core shortcuts, for example:
`[k] Kill   [Enter] Details   [/] Search   [r] Refresh   [q] Quit`

### Details Modal (`Enter`)

Display:
- Port
- PID
- Process name
- Full command
- Working directory
- Start time
- Protocol

Rules:
- `Esc` or `q` closes modal.
- Modal overlays clearly without unnecessary background redraw.
- Preserve table selection state when modal closes.

### Kill Flow (`k`)

Required sequence:
1. User presses `k`.
2. Confirmation modal appears.
3. User confirms with `y`.
4. Show success or error feedback.
5. Refresh table automatically.

Feedback copy style:
- Success: `Port 3000 terminated.`
- Error: `Failed to kill port 3000 (permission denied).`

### Search Mode (`/`)

- Input appears at bottom.
- Filtering updates in real time.
- `Esc` clears/cancels search.
- Interaction should feel immediate.

### Sorting (`s`)

Cycle sort key through:
- Port
- Uptime
- Process

Show the active sort indicator in the table header.

## Layout Guidelines

Structure:
- title/header,
- main table,
- bottom status/help bar.

Prefer whitespace and alignment over heavy border usage.

Responsive behavior for narrow terminals:
1. Keep `Port`.
2. Keep `Process`.
3. Keep `Uptime`.
4. Truncate `Project` first.

Never break layout; truncate gracefully using `...`.

## Performance Guidelines

- Use manual refresh by default.
- Avoid continuous polling as the baseline behavior.
- Optional watch mode can be added later.
- No background daemon.
- Keep memory usage minimal.

## Error Handling UX

Errors must be:
- visible,
- understandable,
- non-fatal to UI responsiveness.

Handle common cases clearly:
- permission denied,
- command parsing failed,
- no ports found.

Preferred empty state copy:
`No listening ports found. Time to cook something.`

## UX Non-Goals

- No mouse-first interaction.
- No complex nested menus.
- No maze-like multi-screen navigation.
- No heavy animations.

Keep UX sharp and direct.

## Definition of Great UX for TAPAS

A developer should be able to:
- instantly understand what is running,
- free a port in under 3 seconds,
- avoid confusion,
- use the tool without reading documentation first.

## Final Rule

If an interaction makes TAPAS slower, heavier, or more complicated, remove it.
TAPAS is a small plate, not a buffet.
